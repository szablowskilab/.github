# Laboratory for Noninvasive Neuroengineering

### We are developing technologies for noninvasive control and monitoring of the brain.
In our work, we combine synthetic biology, molecular engineering, and strategies for enhanced gene and
drug delivery into the central nervous system. Our goals are to understand neural circuit function and
treat brain disorders with fewer side effects.

*Keywords:* gene delivery, protein engineering, neuromodulation, viral vector engineering, ultrasound.
